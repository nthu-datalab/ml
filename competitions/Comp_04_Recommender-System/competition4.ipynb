    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this competition, your goal is to design a recommender system that suggests news articles to users. The performance of your recommender system will be assessed using a simulation environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each timestep, the simulation environment randomly selects an active user with a given `user_id`. Once you receive this `user_id`, your recommender system must generate a slate **(a list of 5 distinct `item_ids` to recommend to the current user)** and pass it to the environment. The environment then uses its internal information to determine which item the user will choose from the recommended list (with some degree of stochasticity) or decide not to choose any item due to a lack of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each user has a latent patience value (invisible to your recommender system), which slightly increases when an item is chosen and drastically decreases when no item is chosen in each round. If a user's patience drops below 0 or the user runs out of the time budget (2000 timesteps), the user leaves the environment. The chosen `item_id` (or `-1` if no item is chosen) and whether the current user stays (`True`) or leaves (`False`) are returned as the result of recommending a slate of items. A new user (if any) will be randomly selected for recommendations in the next timestep after the response of the current user is generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your recommender system should continue recommending items to the current user at each timestep as long as there are still active users in the environment. The simulation process terminates after all users have left the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your goal is to maximize the session length of each user.** The session length is defined as the number of timesteps a user interacts with your recommender system before leaving the environment. The calculated session length score, normalized to the range of 0 ~ 1, will be provided by the simulation environment after the completion of the simulation process."
